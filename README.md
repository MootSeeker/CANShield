## Circuit Description
This project includes the development and implementation of a custom development board with the NXP TJA1443 CAN-FD chip. The board connects to an Nucleo-64 development board, specifically the Nucleo-32G0B1, to fully exploit the capabilities of the CAN-FD interface.

The main purpose of this project is to utilize the full potential of the NXP TJA1443 chip in a CAN-FD network. By integrating this chip with the Nucleo-32G0B1, we aim to develop and test various protocols within the CAN network, providing a robust platform for CAN-FD communication.

Key Features:
- **NXP TJA1443 CAN-FD Chip**: High-speed CAN transceiver with advanced features for CAN-FD networks.
- **Nucleo-32G0B1 Compatibility**: Utilizes the STM32G0 microcontroller with integrated CAN-FD support.
- **Custom Development Board**: Tailored design for easy integration and testing of CAN-FD protocols.
- **Protocol Development and Testing**: Focus on creating and evaluating various protocols within the CAN network.

This project provides a comprehensive platform for developing and testing CAN-FD protocols, leveraging the capabilities of the NXP TJA1443 chip and the Nucleo-32G0B1 development board.

## Hardware Requirements
To get started with CANShield, you will need the following hardware components:
- **STM32 Nucleo-64 Board**: The main development board that hosts the STM32 microcontroller.
